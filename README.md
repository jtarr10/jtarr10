- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jtarr10
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in cloud application development, game development and design.
- Iâ€™m currently experienced in the use of Unity Engine, React.js, Maven, Gradle, Python, and Spring Boot Framework. I actively use most of these in my daily
career as a Senior Software Engineer at Travelport Ltd.
- I am working with a team of my peers to develop a video game in Unity called Reiteration. We are projected to have our MVP finished by the end of 2024, so stay tuned.
